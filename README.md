# Introduction
Face recognition in scenarios where limited training data is available is a challenging task. This project explores the use of Siamese Neural Networks to perform One-Shot & Few-Shot Face Recognition. The Siamese architecture enables learning embeddings for faces and facilitates recognition, even when there are minimal samples available for a particular individual.
